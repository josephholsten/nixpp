# NAME

b - load named files in an editor

## SYNOPSIS

`b` [*file*]

## BUGS


`B(1)` is intended to open a new buffer in the default editor. This released version does not support this yet, but instead just opens a new editor, which is better than having muscle memory break entirely.

## HISTORY

`B(1)` was originally a wrapper to open a new file in the default editor on Plan 9. This has a long way to go to get there, but is working on it.
